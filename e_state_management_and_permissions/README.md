## Why Do We Need State Management?
As your app grows, managing state in just one widget or with setState() becomes:
- Repetitive
- Confusing
- Difficult to debug
- Hard to scale<br>
**That’s where state management comes in.**
- State management is how you organize, update, and share app data across widgets in a clean and predictable way.

## Why Use State Management?
Let’s say you fetch a list of products from an API and display them across:
- A product list screen
- A cart screen
- A checkout screen<br>
**Without state management:**
- You’d pass data manually between widgets
- You’d duplicate logic
- Changes wouldn’t auto-update UI<br>
**With state management (e.g., Provider or Riverpod):**
- You store the product list in a central provider
- Any widget can access and update it
- UI auto-reacts when data changes

## When, Why, and What state management tool to use in real-world Flutter projects
You don’t need a state management package for everything. Start by asking:
- Does this data change over time?
- Does this data need to be shared across multiple widgets/screens?<br>
**If yes, you need state management. If no, local setState() is fine.**

## Real-World Decision Table (with Use Cases)
1. **Situation**<br>
Button toggle / counter / local form field
    - **Why You Need State**<br>
    Only 1 widget updates itself
    - **Best Solution**<br>
    setState()<br>
2. **Situation**<br>
Pass data from one screen to another
    - **Why You Need State**<br>
    Can’t use setState() across screens
    - **Best Solution**<br>
    Provider, Riverpod
3. **Situation**<br>
Login/logout & user session across app
    - **Why You Need State**<br>
    Shared across screens, needs persistence
    - **Best Solution**<br>
    Provider, Riverpod, Bloc
4. **Situation**<br>
Form validation with multiple fields
    - **Why You Need State**<br>
    You need to show real-time error states, manage input logic
    - **Best Solution**<br>
    Cubit, Formz, Provider
5. **Situation**<br>
API data (e.g., product list)
    - **Why You Need State**<br>
    Used in many places (list, detail, cart)
    - **Best Solution**<br>
    Riverpod, Bloc, GetX
6. **Situation**<br>
Dark mode / language switcher
    - **Why You Need State**<br>
    Global app-level UI state	
    - **Best Solution**<br>
    Provider, Riverpod, Bloc
