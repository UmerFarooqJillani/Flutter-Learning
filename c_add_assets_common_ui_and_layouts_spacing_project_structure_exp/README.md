    - Maintain clean, error-free code.
    - Improve readability and consistency.
#### Should You Edit analysis_options.yaml/
##### Yes, optionally.
- Add or remove lint rules based on your team or project coding standards.
- You can extend from predefined sets (e.g., package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml).<br>

linter:
  rules:
    avoid_print: true
    always_declare_return_types: true
```
### ðŸ“„ pubspec.lock/

- Ensures that everyone on your team uses the exact same package versions.
- Created automatically when you run flutter pub get.
#### Should You Edit pubspec.lock/
##### No, do not manually edit.

    - Assets (images, fonts)
    - Environment constraints (Dart SDK version)
#### Should You Edit pubspec.yaml/
##### Yes!
Youâ€™ll edit this file often to:
- Add dependencies
- Register assets or fonts
- Configure app metadata
- Always run flutter pub get after changing it.

## <p align="center"> Add and Display Images </p>
--- 
### Assets (local images stored in your project)
1. Create an assets/ folder: 
```
    my_flutter_app/
    â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ images/
    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ my_image.png
```
2. Register the image in **pubspec.yaml**
```
flutter:
    assets:
        - assets/images/my_image.png   # For Specific Images
``` 
You can include all images in a folder:
```
  assets:
    - assets/images/
```
3. Use Image.asset() in your widget
```
    Image.asset('assets/images/my_image.png')
```
### Network (images loaded from the internet)
```Dart
Image.network(
  'https://example.com/image.jpg',
  width: 200,
  height: 200,
  fit: BoxFit.cover,
)
```
### Memory or File (advanced, usually with plugins like image_picker, file, etc.)
You can use the **cached_network_image** package for caching & placeholders

--- 
## <p align="center"> Custom fonts in Flutter</p>
--- 
### Internal Fonts (Local Fonts / Custom Fonts)
- Add font files to your project
- Put your **.ttf** font files inside a folder like:
``` 
    my_flutter_app/
    â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ fonts/
    â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ Poppins-Regular.ttf
    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Poppins-Bold.ttf
```
- Register fonts in pubspec.yaml
``` 
flutter:
  fonts:
    - family: Poppins
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
``` 
- Use the custom font in Text
```
    Text(
      'Hello World!',
      style: TextStyle(
        fontFamily: 'Poppins',   
        fontSize: 24,
        fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
      ),
    )
``` 
### External Fonts (Google Fonts Package)
- Go to 
```
    https://pub.dev/packages/google_fonts/install
```
or run 
```
flutter pub add google_fonts
```
- This will add a line like this to your package's **pubspec.yaml** (and run an implicit flutter pub get):
```
    dependencies:
      google_fonts: ^6.2.1   # (Add dependencies)
```
- Import it 
``` 
import 'package:google_fonts/google_fonts.dart';
```

## <P align="center"> Even Spacing Widgets </p>
--- 
### Padding
- Adds space inside the widgetâ€™s boundary (between the widget and its child).
```dart
Padding(
  padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0), // uniform padding
  child: Text('Padded Text'),
)
// EdgeInsets.all(value) â†’ same padding on all sides
// EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 10, vertical: 20)
// EdgeInsets.only(left: 10, right: 5)
``` 
### Margin (via Container)
- Adds space outside the widget, between the widget and other siblings.
```Dart
Container(
  margin: EdgeInsets.all(20), // outside spacing
  child: Text('Text with Margin'),
)
```
### SizedBox
- Adds fixed-size spacing or invisible box between widgets.
```dart
SizedBox(height: 20), // vertical space
SizedBox(width: 10),  // horizontal space
``` 
- Or use it to wrap a widget and give it a fixed size:
``` dart
SizedBox(
  width: 100,
  height: 50,
  child: ElevatedButton(
    onPressed: () {},
    child: Text('Fixed Size Button'),
  ),
)
``` 
### MainAxisAlignment & CrossAxisAlignment
- Used in Row, Column, and Flex widgets to control spacing between children.<br>
Example:
```dart
Column(
  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly, // space between children and the main axis of row are horizontally 
  crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,     // alignment horizontally and the cross axis of row are vertically
  children: [
    Text("One"),
    Text("Two"),
    Text("Three"),
  ],
)
``` 
### Spacer Widget
- Creates flexible empty space between widgets in a Row or Column.
``` dart
Row(
  children: [
    Text("Left"),
    Spacer(),              // pushes the next widget to the end
    Text("Right"),
  ],
)
``` 
### Align Widget
- Used to align a widget within its parent and can affect positioning (acts like spacing sometimes).
- It does not create space between widgets but rather positions a widget inside its parent container.
``` dart
Align(
  alignment: Alignment.bottomRight,
  child: Text("Aligned Text"),
)
``` 
### Expanded Widget
- Expands a child of a Row, Column, or Flex to fill the remaining space.
```dart
Row(
  children: [
    Expanded(child: Text("This fills available space")),
    Icon(Icons.arrow_forward),
  ],
),
```
