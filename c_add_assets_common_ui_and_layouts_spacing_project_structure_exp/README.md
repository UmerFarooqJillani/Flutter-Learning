Yes
### ðŸ“‚ linux/
#### Purpose:
- The linux/ directory contains native platform-specific code and project setup files required to build, run, and package Flutter apps for Linux desktops.

- Allows you to automate testing and verify that your code behaves as expected.
#### Should You Edit test/
##### Yes, highly recommended.
- Write tests for logic, widgets, UI, and business rules.
- No, only if you're just prototyping or doing a small demo (but not best practice).
- **Example file:** test/widget_test.dart (default test template when app is created).
### ðŸ“‚ web/
#### Purpose:
- Contains files to build and run your Flutter app as a web app in browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
- Uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript compiled from Dart/Flutter.
#### Should You Edit web/

#### Should You Edit .metadata/
##### No.

    - Enforce code style (e.g., no unused imports, type safety).
    - Maintain clean, error-free code.
    - Improve readability and consistency.
#### Should You Edit analysis_options.yaml/
##### Yes, optionally.
- Add or remove lint rules based on your team or project coding standards.
- You can extend from predefined sets (e.g., package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml).<br>
Example:
```
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml
linter:
  rules:
    avoid_print: true
    always_declare_return_types: true
```
### ðŸ“„ pubspec.lock/

- Ensures that everyone on your team uses the exact same package versions.
- Created automatically when you run flutter pub get.
#### Should You Edit pubspec.lock/
##### No, do not manually edit.
- It is auto-managed.

    - Environment constraints (Dart SDK version)
#### Should You Edit pubspec.yaml/
##### Yes!
Youâ€™ll edit this file often to:
- Add dependencies
- Register assets or fonts
- Configure app metadata
- Always run flutter pub get after changing it.

## <p align="center"> Add and Display Images </p>
--- 
### Assets (local images stored in your project)
1. Create an assets/ folder: 
```
    my_flutter_app/
    â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ images/
    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ my_image.png
```
2. Register the image in **pubspec.yaml**
```
flutter:
    assets:
        - assets/images/my_image.png   # For Specific Images
``` 
You can include all images in a folder:
```
  assets:
    - assets/images/
```
3. Use Image.asset() in your widget
```
    Image.asset('assets/images/my_image.png')
```
### Network (images loaded from the internet)
```Dart
Image.network(
  'https://example.com/image.jpg',
  width: 200,
  height: 200,
  fit: BoxFit.cover,
)
```
### Memory or File (advanced, usually with plugins like image_picker, file, etc.)
You can use the **cached_network_image** package for caching & placeholders
